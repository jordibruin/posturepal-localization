If you want to help translate Posture Pal to your language, please make a PR and fill in the info below so I can credit you in the app!

Before you start translating, check the open PRs to check if your language isn't already translated. It's also a good idea to already mark yourself on the list below if you're still working on it, so that nobody else does work that's not necessary! 

You will receive a promo code to unlock Posture Pal Pro for free. It should take 5-10 minutes of your time, thanks a lot!
